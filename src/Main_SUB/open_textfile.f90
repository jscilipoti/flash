subroutine open_textfile(filename,array,max_lines,max_chars)
    ! A subroutine that reads each line of a file and saves its values in an 
    ! array. There is a maximum number of lines in the file and
    ! maximum number of characters per line allowed to read.
    ! The OPEN statement can connect an existing external file to a unit, 
    ! create a file and connect it to a unit, or change some specifiers of the
    ! connection.The following provides a detailed list of the OPEN specifier 
    ! keywords:
    ! - UNIT=u: 
    !       u is an interger expression that specifies the unit number where
    !       the external file is connected.
    ! - FILE=fin:
    !       fin is a character string containing the name and path of the 
    !       file being opened.     
    ! - ACCESS=acc: 
    !       The "ACCESS=acc" clause is optional. "acc" is a character 
    !       expression. If ACCESS='DIRECT': RECL must also be given, 
    !       since all I/O transfers are done in multiples of fixed-size 
    !       records. A direct-access file contains a number of records that 
    !       are written to or read from by referring to the record number. 
    !       Direct access is also called random access.
    !       If FORM is not given, formatted transfer is assumed. 
    ! - FORM=fm:
    !       The FORM=fm clause is optional. fm is a character expression.
    !       The default is 'FORMATTED'.
    !       If FORM='FORMATTED', each record is terminated with a newline 
    !       (\n) character; that is, each record actually has one extra 
    !        character.
    ! - RECL=rl:
    !       The RECL=rl clause is required if ACCESS='DIRECT' and 
    !       ignored otherwise. It indicates the length of each record in a 
    !       file connected for direct access, or the maximum length of a 
    !       record in a file connected for sequential access. (recl=850)
    ! - ACTION=act:
    !       This specifier denotes file permissions. Possible values are: 
    !       READ, WRITE, and READWRITE.
    !       If act is READ, it specifies that the file is opened read-only.
    !       If act is WRITE, it specifies that the file is opened 
    !       write-only. You cannot execute a BACKSPACE statement on a 
    !       write-only file.
    !       If act is READWRITE, it specifies that the file is opened with 
    !       both read and write permissions.
    ! - ERR=s
    !   The ERR=s clause is optional. s is a statement label of a statement to 
    !   branch to if an error occurs during execution of the OPEN statement.
    ! - IOSTAT=ios:
    !       The IOSTAT=ios clause is optional. ios is an integer variable 
    !       that receives the error status from an OPEN. After the execution of 
    !       the OPEN, if no error condition exists, then ios is zero; otherwise,
    !       it is some positive number.
    !       If you want to avoid aborting the program when an error occurs on 
    !       an OPEN, include ERR=s or IOSTAT=ios.
    ! - STATUS=sta:
    !       The STATUS=sta clause is optional. 
    !       sta is a character expression. Possible values are: 
    !       'OLD', 'NEW', 'UNKNOWN', or 'SCRATCH'.
    !       If sta is 'OLD', the file already exists (nonexistence is an error).
